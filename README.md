# SIL

## Create a SIL File in Go

Changing fairly often right now but starting to stabilize on needed API. 
Working towards passing a SIL type and getting []bytes back of the created SIL file

Mostly stripped of CLK specific code, just not tested with another type yet. Refactoring code needs work and cleaning up.

A tag is needed for the F code, this way the type elements can be human readable
