# SIL

## Create a SIL File in Go

Changing fairly often right now but starting to stabilize on needed API. 
Working towards passing a SIL type and getting []bytes back of the created SIL file

Right now works with LOC SMS for making CLK database tables but the API is changing quickly and soon should be able to make SIL files that should work as long as the right fields are passed within a couple weeks
